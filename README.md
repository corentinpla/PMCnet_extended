# PMCnet_extended
I propose two methods of uncertainity quantification...
* The first is based on [2]. It decomposes the BNN output variation in an epistemic and in an aleatoric one.
* The second is based on [3]. It calculates uncertainty using a nearest-neighbor approach.

...as well as some improvements of PMCnet, the code implemented from this paper [1]. 
* A new approach for metrics calculations
* Important bug fixes for sampling importance points
* A second variance reduction method : simulated annealing
* A results visualisation module
